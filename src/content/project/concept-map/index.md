## Introduction

I have created a map of various scientific concepts. It helps me to organize my
ideas and keep notes. I find concept maps more useful than other more traditional means
of organizing information like complicated note taking applications, personal wikies or latex
documents.

## Overview

So far the map contains the following main concepts with various sub-concepts
that I constantly update:

- Computer Science

  - Machine Learning

  - Software Engineering

  - Data Structures

## Concept Map

click on the background of the diagram, then drag the zoom icon up or down to
zoom in or out.
